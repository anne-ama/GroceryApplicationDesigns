# Grocery Application Designs

Task: Create wireframe and mockups for a grocery mobile application 

Owner Notes: This was an assigned task for my 'Applications, Modelling and Design' Course in my second year of University. I had a tonne of fun completing this and utilised Figma to create these prototypes. In order to see the complete flow and user interactions, I have included some links (see below).
